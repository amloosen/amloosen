I'm a researcher & computational scientist investigating cognition and mental health with neuroscientific, computational and digital tools! 🧠 ⚙️ 
I combine cognitive neuroscience, computational psychiatry, and real-world applications to create fun, gamified cognitive tasks and symptom assessments that enable us to research the general public and specific patient groups. 💡📱

- Cognitive & Symptom Assessment In- and Outside the Lab 🎯 💻:
I design and implement digital cognitive tasks and web- and mobile app assessments to capture decision-making, learning, and mental health symptom patterns. By combining behavioral experiments, neuroscientific data, and computational tools, I aim to get key insights into cognition and mental health conditions. 🤖💥

- Real-World Impact 🌍:
From clinical samples to large-scale public datasets, I’m passionate about turning research into accessible tools. My work includes tracking psychiatric symptoms during global events (COVID-19 😷) and crafting cognitive assessments that prioritize participant engagement and data privacy. 🔒✨

- Outreach & Science Communication 📣:
I believe science should be fun and accessible! Projects like OCD and the Brain (https://ocdandthebrain.com/en) and my role in the SPICE Summer Program in Computational Education (https://www.neurocpu.org/spice) help demystify neuroscientific and mental health research and empower people with information.🔍
